# Git Basics

## Introduction

### What is version control?

A version control system (VCS) is a program or set of programs that tracks changes to a collection of files. One goal of a VCS is to easily recall earlier versions of individual files or of the entire project. Another goal is to allow several team members to work on a project, even on the same files, at the same time without affecting each other's work. 

With a VCS, you can: 

See all the changes made to your project, when the changes were made, and who made them. 

Include a message with each change to explain the reasoning behind it. 

Retrieve past versions of the entire project or of individual files. 

Create branches, where changes can be made experimentally. This feature allows several different sets of changes (for example, features or bug fixes) to be worked on at the same time, possibly by different people, without affecting the main branch. Later, you can merge the changes you want to keep back into the main branch. 

Attach a tag to a versionâ€”for example, to mark a new release.

### What is Git? 

Git is an open-source version control system and is the most widely used vcs in the tech industry. 

There are a number of ways we can interact with Git: 

Command Line 

Visual Studio GUI/Visual Studio code GUI 

GitHub desktop app 

Common Git terms: 

Working tree 

Repository 

Branch 

## Git Commands

Introduction to Git - Learn | Microsoft Docs 

 

 

Fundamental Git Commands 

Git clone 

This command allows you get a copy of an existing git repository 

Every file and update from that branch, is pulled into the folder you initiate git clone in 

Git status 

This command gives up the status of the branch you are in e.g. nothing to commit, working tree is clean 

Git Fetch 

The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on. (Git Fetch | Atlassian Git Tutorial) 

It allows you to see the history of the branch without affecting your local work on the branch 

Git add 

 

Git Checkout 

Git checkout is used to switch to a specific branch 

For example, you may create a new branch and switch from master to the newly created branch 

Git Commit 

 

Git Pull 

The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 

( Git Pull | Atlassian Git Tutorial) 

Git Push 

The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.( Git Push | Atlassian Git Tutorial)

### Git workflow

Version control has a general workflow that most developers use when writing code and sharing it with the team. Git has a version of this workflow using terminology and commands unique to Git. 

These steps are:

- Clone/Create a repository
  - **Clone an existing repository** from the project in DevOps.
  - If required, you can **Create a new repository** for the project in DevOps.
- Get a local copy of code if they don't have one yet.
  - **Create a branch** for the changes you plan to make and give it a name, such as users/jamal/fix-bug-3214 or cool-feature-x.
- Make changes to code to fix bugs or add new features.
  - **Commit changes** to your branch. People often have multiple commits for a bug fix or feature.
  - **Push your branch** to the remote repository.
- Once the code is ready, make it available for review by your team.
  - **Create a pull request** so other people can review your changes. To incorporate feedback, you might need to make more commits and push more changes.
- Once the code is reviewed, merge it into the team's shared codebase.
  - **Complete your pull request** and resolve any merge conflicts from changes other people made after you created your branch.

Throughout the rest of this lab tutorial you'll learn about how to use the above commands.

## Clone an existing repository

### Visual Studio 2019

- Sign in Visual Studio with your account.

![Signin.png](.attachments/git-basics/signin.png)

- In Team Explorer, open the Connect page by selecting the Connect button. Choose Manage Connections then Connect to Project.

![connecttoproject01.png](.attachments/git-basics/connecttoproject01.png)

- In Connect to a Project, select the repo you want to clone from the list and select Clone. **Note:** I recommend creating a new folder "workspaces" on C drive to keep your code instead of the default path.

## Create a new repository

### Create a repo using the web portal

Navigate to the Repos page in your project.

![newrepository](.attachments/git-basics/newrepository01.png)

From the repo drop-down, select New repository.

![newrepository](.attachments/git-basics/newrepository02.png)

In the Create a new repository dialog, verify that Git is the repo type and enter a name for your new repo. You can also add a README and create a .gitignore for the type of code you plan to manage in the repo. A README contains information about the code in your repo. The .gitignore file tells Git which types of files to ignore, such as temporary build files from your development environment.

Set options for your new repo in the Create a Git repo dialog. When you're happy with the repo name and choices, select Create.

![newrepository](.attachments/git-basics/newrepository03.png)

You will now have a new repository in your project. 

![newrepository](.attachments/git-basics/newrepository04.png)

You can follow the previous step to clone this new repository to your local and start using it.

## Create a branch

Open up Team Explorer and go to the Branches view.

Right-click the parent branch (usually main) to base your changes and choose New Local Branch From....

Supply a branch name in the required field and select Create Branch. Visual Studio automatically performs a checkout to the newly created branch.

## Commit changes

Git does not automatically add changed files to the snapshot when you create a commit. You must first stage your changes to let Git know which updates you want to add to the next commit. Staging lets you to selectively add files to a commit while excluding changes made in other files.

### Stage changes

Stage individual file changes by right-clicking a file in the Change view and selecting Stage. Staging a change creates a Staged Changes section in Team Explorer. Only changes in the Staged Changes section are added to the next commit.

Stage multiple files or folders by selecting them then right-clicking and choosing Stage or by dragging and dropping files from the Changes list into the Staged Changes list.

Ignore files by right-clicking and selecting Ignore this local item or Ignore this extension. This adds an entry to the .gitignore file in your local repo. If the ignored file was added to your repo in an earlier commit, ignoring the file will not remove it from the Changes list. See excluding and ignoring files section for more information on how to ignore files already tracked by Git.

### Create a commit

Open the Changes view in Team Explorer.

Enter a commit message describing your changes and select Commit Staged to create a new commit that includes the changes listed in the Staged Changes section.

Skip staging files if you just want to commit all changes listed by entering a commit message and selecting Commit All when you have no staged changes.

## Push your branch

When you commit in Visual Studio you can **push** the commit and sync the branch with a remote repository. These options are available in the drop-down on the **Commit** button. Git makes sure that pushed changes are consistent with the remote branch. Others can pull your commits and merge them into their own local copy of the branch. 


Git makes sure that pushed changes are consistent with the remote branch. Others can pull your commits and merge them into their own local copy of the branch. Pushed branches that have finished work are reviewed and merged into the main branch of your repo through a pull request.

In this tutorial you learn how to:

 Note

If you're using Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 or later, try the Git version control experience. Learn more about how the Git experience compares with Team Explorer on this Side-by-side comparison page.

In Team Explorer, select Home and then choose Sync to open Synchronization.

Synchronization

You can also go to Synchronization from the Changes view by choosing Sync immediately after making a commit.

Go to Synchronization from the Changes view immediately after making a commit.

Select Push to share your commit with the remote repository.

Push

During your first push to the repository, you'll see the following message in place of the outgoing commits list: The current branch does not track a remote branch. Push your changes to a new branch on the origin remote and set the upstream branch. Select Push to push your changes to a new branch on the remote repository and set the upstream branch. The next time you push changes you'll see the list of commits.

After the PR is created, select Open in browser to open the new PR in the Azure DevOps web portal.

You can also create PRs from the Branches view in Team Explorer by right-clicking the branch name and selecting Create Pull Request.


## Complete your pull request

Once all required reviewers approve your pull request (PR) and the PR meets all branch policy requirements, you can merge your changes into the target branch and complete the PR. Or if you decide not to proceed with the changes in the PR, you can abandon the PR.

You can access PRs from Visual Studio Team Explorer:

Connect to your project from Visual Studio.

Select View > Team Explorer to open Team Explorer. You can also press Ctrl+\, Ctrl+M.

From Home, select Pull Requests to view lists of PRs opened by you or assigned to you.

To open a PR in the web portal, right-click the PR and select Open in browser.

To complete a PR, open the PR in the browser, and on the Overview page, select Complete or set other options.
