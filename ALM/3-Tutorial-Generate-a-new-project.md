# Generate a new project

## Introduction


### What you will build
In this tutorial, you will generate a set of files files for a new project based on a standardised template that will :
- Generates a set of structured files that hold the base configuration for a new project which is uploaded (pushed) to a new repository in Azure DevOps
- Create pipelines which builds, validates and deploys code to specified environments
- Can also generate additional files during the project lifecycle as the solution grows
- Generate project itself - CMD
- GeneratingÂ a solution storage place
- Install as unmanaged in <Project Name>Master environment
- Install that solution as managed into the 'build' environment
- Using the ADO generator to create the pipelines etc - inputs and outputs
- Setup branch policies and repo permissions

To achieve this, you'll use our internal tool, [Project Generator](https://github.com/Capgemini/powerapps-project-template). 

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have access to our MACE team in Github
- Download the LTS version of NPM from this link
- Install VS Code


## Download and install NodeJS & NPM

- Open the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) website
- Download the latest LTS version
- Run the downloaded installer

## Clone tool

First you will need to create a new directory in windows explorer where will install all our project files in this lab. Call the folder **alm-labs** for the purpose of this lab.

Open CMD within your newly created folder by typing CMD in **Windows explorer** and press **Enter**
![image.png](.attachments/alm-new-project/image1.png)

A new command prompt window should open with the path pointing to your newly created folder.
![image.png](.attachments/alm-new-project/image2.png)

All commands throughout the lab will be entered in **Command prompt**

Clone the PowerApps project template Github repository to your local machine by running
`
git clone https://github.com/Capgemini/powerapps-project-template.git
`

When prompted to sign into Github, please sign in.

If successful, the output should be as illustrated below
```
Cloning into 'powerapps-project-template'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 1253, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1253/1253), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (622/622), done.
Rremote: Total 1253 (delta 532), reused 1204 (delta 487), pack-reused 0eceiving                1228/125

Resolving deltas: 100% (532/532), done.
Updating files: 100% (165/165), done.
```
## Build the generator

In command prompt change directory into the project folder you created in the **Clone tool** step of this lab by entering `cd powerapps-project-template`

Install **Yomen** with the command `npm install yo -g`

First we need the project dependencies, to get these run `npm install`

Now we're going to build **powerapps-project-template** tool by running `npm run build`

Finally run `npm link` to install the local package as a global tool, to be used in the next step

You may see a few warnings when running the above commands but these can be ignored.

## Generate base project

Stay in command prompt but go back to the directory **alm-labs** using `cd ../`

Create a new directory where we will be storing our generated files `mkdir sample-project` and change directory into the newly created project folder using `cd sample-project`

Now we are going to generate the base file structure for our project by running `yo @capgemini/cdspackage`

It may take a few seconds for you to be prompted, but eventually you will be prompted for several inputs:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Input
        </th>
        <th>
            Purpose
        </th>
        <th>
            Example
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Name of the client?
        </td>
        <td>
            Used within naming files and folders produced by the generator
        </td>
        <td>
            MACE
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Name of the package?
        </td>
        <td>
            Used creating files, folders and PowerApps solutions
        </td>
        <td>
            ALMLAB
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Open the generated project in either VS Code or the file explorer and take this opportunity to browse through the files seeing what was created and how the values you've entered have been passed into the naming of files and folders.

To open your project in VS Code from command prompt run `code .`

## Generate solution

Now we are going to generate our solution structure by running `yo @capgemini/cdspackage:solution`
You will again be prompted for several inputs:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Input
        </th>
        <th>
            Purpose
        </th>
        <th>
            Example
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Publisher prefix?
        </td>
        <td>
            Used to prefix components in PowerApps and is mapped to the solution prefix
        </td>
        <td>
            MACE
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Name of the client?
        </td>
            Used within naming files and folders produced by the generator, entered in the above **Generate solution** step. The command prompt will recognise your previously entered value and suggest the value which you can accept as a default by pressing enter
        <td>
        </td>
        <td>
            MACE
        </td>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Name of the package?
        </td>
        <td>
            Used creating files, folders and PowerApps solutions, entered in the above **Generate solution** step. The command prompt will recognise your previously entered value and suggest the value which you can accept as a default by pressing enter
        </td>
        <td>
            ALMLAB
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Name of the solution?
        </td>
        <td>
            Used to create the name of your solution in PowerApps
        </td>
        <td>
            Sample
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Development environment URL?
        </td>
        <td>
            Stored within the repository to be used for local extractions  of solutions and config e.g. code generation. **Be sure to prefix URL with https://**
        </td>
        <td>
            _Paste the Development environment URL from notepad which we copied earlier in the lab_
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Are changes to this promoted using a staging environment?
        </td>
        <td>
        </td>
        <td>
            Y
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Staging environment URL?
        </td>
        <td>
            Used for extracting the solution locally or in the generated pipeline  **Be sure to prefix URL with https://**
        </td>
        <td>
            _Paste the Master environment URL from notepad which we copied earlier in the lab_
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tr>
</table>

You will then be prompted to overwrite the following files:
- tasks.json
<br>
`Writing solution configuration...
Updating tasks.json...
Updating import config to include new solution.
   create src\solutions\{{prefix}}_{{Package}}_{{Solution}}\MappingFile.xml
   create src\solutions\{{prefix}}_{{Package}}_{{Solution}}\spkl.json
   create src\solutions\{{prefix}}_{{Package}}_{{Solution}}\solution.json
 conflict .vscode\tasks.json
? Overwrite .vscode\tasks.json? (ynaxdH)`
<br>
Enter `y` and press **Enter**

- ImportConfig.xml
<br>
`force .vscode\tasks.json
 conflict deploy\PkgFolder\ImportConfig.xml
? Overwrite deploy\PkgFolder\ImportConfig.xml? (ynaxdH)`
<br>
Enter `y` and press **Enter**

## Run automated Azure DevOps setup

First, you need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) so that the generator can talk to Azure DevOps on behalf of your account. 

Open Azure DevOps, select **User settings** (user icon with a little cog) and select **Personal access tokens** 

![image.png](.attachments/alm-new-project/image4.png)

Select **+ New Token** then enter 'Generator' as the name, select an expiry date of today or tomorrow, and for scopes select Full Access. 

![image.png](.attachments/alm-new-project/image5.png)

![image.png](.attachments/alm-new-project/image6.png)

Copy the token to notepad as you'll need this later. 

<p style="background: #FF4400;">
If Package Name and Azure DevOps Project name are the same then the generator will fail. In this case, rename the pre-created repo in Azure Devops by: 
1. Go to the Project Settings
2. Under Repos, select Repositories
3. For the repo with the same name, use the three dots to rename the repo to '[existing name]_old'
</p>

Now you are going to set up Azure DevOps by running `yo @capgemini/cdspackage:azuredevops`. You'll be asked the following questions:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Input
        </th>
        <th>
            Purpose
        </th>
        <th>
            Example
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	    <td>

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
		    CI Environment URL?
        </td>
        <td>
		    The URL of the CI environment used for the solution checker and deploying to CI environment
        </td>
        <td>
		    https://[???].crm11.dynamics.com
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
		    Service Account Email?
        </td>
        <td>
		    The email address to use for the UI automation tests and running the extract pipeline. This user needs access to the 3 Power Platform Environments
        </td>
        <td>
		    If you don't have a service account, you can use your own for now and update these details later.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
		    Service Account Password?
        </td>
        <td>
		    Used in conjunction with the Service Account Username.
        </td>
        <td>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
		    enant ID?
        </td>
        <td>
		    Used for creating the Service Connection in Azure DevOps which is used for the solution checker and deploying to CI environment
        </td>
        <td>
		    _Paste value from notepad which copied earlier in the lab_
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
